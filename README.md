# Community sandbox
A repository for ping users to build and share scripts, code snippets, demos, or tutorials, without messing with the package's source code or official tutorials

## Set up
Create a conda environment with a suitable version of python

```
(base) > conda env create -n ping python=3.11
```

Activate the environment and install themachinethatgoesping

```
(base) > conda activate ping
(ping) > pip install themachinethatgoesping
```

Install some common requirements for most demos
```
(ping) > pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Code away...
