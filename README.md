A repository to build scripts, code snippets, demos, tutorials... without messing with the package's source code

Create a conda environment with a suitable version of python and jupyterlab

```
(base) > conda env create -n ping python=3.10 jupyterlab
```

Activate the environment and install themachinethatgoesping

```
(base) > conda activate ping
(ping) > pip install themachienthatgoesping
```

Code away...
